# Docker_Task
# Docker final task
In this task we have 3 sections:
-  Create a Python APP (Flask Based).
-  Dockerize the applications (Create Dockerfile).
-  Create a Jenkinsfile for CI/CD that creates and pushes the generated Docker image to Docker Hub.


## ✨Python APP- Features:
1-  Presents the Current Bitcoin Price in USD.

## Run the app
1-install python 3.10. 

2-install the requirements 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3- Clone and run the app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SewarDarawshe/DockerFinalTask.git

python ./main.py
```

now you can access the app using : http://localhost:8085/  .





## ✨Dockerize the applications:
 import python: 
```sh
FROM python:3.10.0-alpine3.13
```
 copy the requirements.txt: 
```sh
COPY ./requirements.txt requirements.txt
```
install the required packages:
```sh
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 Copy: lets us copy a file (or files) from the host system into the image: 
```sh
COPY . .
```
 Expose the port of the flask app: 
```sh
EXPOSE 5000
```
 Run: 
```sh
